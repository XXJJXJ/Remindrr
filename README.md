# Remindrr Bot

This is a Discord reminder bot (under development) that resembles the [SE-EDU Duke](https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html) program.

This bot is designed for discord users to create a list of tasks either for themselves or for the group they are in.
This bot aims to provide regular task reminders to help users/groups keep track of their task at hand in order of the deadline.

**Note this bot is designed for users in timezone GMT+8. Support for other timezones will be developed in the future.
